# Haiku

A popular format in the English-speaking world, I never really quite took to it.

There are more "official" rules as to what a haiku is, and certainly writing in English makes for an interestingly constricting exercise in conciseness, which I find increasingly satisfying.

Mostly I follow the format rules of

1. 5-7-5 syllable count
2. Setup-Setup-Resolution
	* in this sense, the first two lines set a context, conundrum or a mood
	* the final line is reserved to offer an extrapolation or a counterpoint to the first two - either contrasting, disjoining, or otherwise being demarcated as a separate Thing.
	* A punchline, but not necessarily comedic.
3. Each line aims to be as empirical as possible. Neutral observations conveying no meaning
	* And where yet meaning arises solely in combination

I do not title them - as a result of the guidelines to structure, using a title would hamper the ability to appreciate the flow.
