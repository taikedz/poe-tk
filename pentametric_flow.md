# Pentametric Flow

Iambic Pentameter is the style most anglophone school children know as `Shakespeare's te-TUM te-TUM te-TUM te-TUM te-TUM`: five pairs of syllables, each pair being formed of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable.

The reason I have chosen this one style for use in writing up this summary is that it yields a rhythm that can be incorporated into longer text; resultingly the sounds that are emitted cause the claims to gain authority by merely sounding similar to that which once the Bard himself had written down. But maybe you are not convinced that this, my simple discourse on the metric form, has any air that may be deemed important, or which sounded even half like poetry? In fact I write in imabs easily; and if you had not noticed, this here text is written by the rules I laid out prior, simply in a bid to make a point.
