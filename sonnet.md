# Sonnets

I once wrote sonnets for fun - many years ago - and I'm not quite the dab hand anymore.

Similarly to Haiku, I enjoy the idea of setting up an idea, or posing a question, and then resolving it.

So the form that I am particularly a fan of is three verses of four lines each { in rhyming couplets (`AABB`), interleaved rhyming couplets (`ABAB`), or that other form (`ABBA`) I cannot name } followed by a last verse comprising of a single rhyming couplet providing an answer, a resolution, or a counterpoint of some sort to the three verses of setup.
